				<p class = "feature-info-detail">Hungry For Burger is a first person hiest game where the player is to steal a golden burger from the notorious fish-mans </p>

				<p class = "feature-info-title">Design Goals</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">To create a game that meets the restrictions of "player traversing past guards guarding a hallway".</p>

			</section>

			<section class = feature-section>
				<p class = "feature-info-title">Roles and Tasks</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">Designer: Designed the level as well as implementing assets.</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">Programmer: Enemy AI, Player Controller, & UI functionality.</p>

				<p class = "feature-info-title">Design Implementation</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> You are hungry and you smell a delicious smell of burger but it leads you down a dark path. Soon you notice you are entering the homes of the fishmans, the dark sewers. But the smell is irresistible and you must find the burger. Sneak around the guards to find the burger. Don't get caught or they will lock down the place!</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> The level is designed for the players to explore but at the same time, learn from previous plays. The game encourages the player to explore the world around them from the beginning and observe the fishmans movements. If players move freely they will get caught and not be able to reach the burger.</p>

				<p class = "feature-info-title">Hardship and Hurdles</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> This is my first 3D project so I had some new things to learn but for the most part, it is quite similar.</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> I have touched Nav Mesh previously but it have always been not very intuitive. So for this project, I wanted to create something easily modified within the editor. To do so, I placed a line renderer on each enemy and the enemy would move depending on how the lines are drawn. Designers can edit it within engine easily by editing points of the line. This way is a lot easier because the line renderer keeps everything in order from first to last.</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> This project is also my first time working with lights in Unity. There were many difficult times working with lighting. I learned that Unity only allows a specific amount of realtime lights until some just stop working. To work around that, I ended up working with emmisive materials and baking mixed light maps to create an illusion of lights.</p>
