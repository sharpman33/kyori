				<p class = "feature-info-detail">Super Koala is a Pac-Man clone where the player is a koala being chased around by fire.</p>

				<p class = "feature-info-title">Design Goals</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">To create a game that resembles Pac-Man by maintaining its main mechanics and features.</p>

			<section class = feature-section>
				<p class = "feature-info-title">Roles and Tasks</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">Designer: Designed the level to resemble Pac-Man in a way as well as implement artworks into the game.</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">Programmer: Enemy AI, Node to Node movement, as well as UI functionality</p>
			</section>

			<section class = feature-section>
				<p class = "feature-info-title">Design Implementation</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> You are the sole koala left at your home and winter is coming up. You must collect enough food for the friends and family. Avoid the fire and collect food while also finding water bottles to put out the fire.</p>
			</section>

			<section class = feature-section>
				<p class = "feature-info-title">Hardship and Hurdles</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> The movement for PacMan is different from most 2D games. So I ended up untilized node to node movement. Both the player and Enemy AI can utilize this. The player moves from node to node which checks the players intended direction and if that node allows that direction, the it would turn the player to move in that direction, otherwise stop. With this method, it feels alot more like PacMan.</p>
