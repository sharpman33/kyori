				<p class = "feature-info-title">Design Implementation</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> The game is set in a supernatural society where light is being enveloped by darkness. You as the player, must go on a journey to return light and defeat darkness. The original design of the game was kept simple with the player scouraging and collecting light particles to return light back to the world whilst defeating enemies. But the gameplay just seemed to simple and boring. So I decided to change how the enemies work. The enemies would roam around the world and when it spots the player, it would attack. But if the player would run away too far, the enemies would keep scrouage the world but would also take light particles that would dim the lights even more. With that, it gives the player a reason to defeat the enemies rather than just roaming around collect light particles. When it was all complete, the game still felt that it was missing something. The player wouldn't have the feeling that the light particle is precious besides the fact it is a like replacement to health because when it reaches 0, the player dies and loses. So we made it that whenever the player shoots to attack an enemy, it would deminish the light even further since he is shooting light particles to defeat the enemies. </p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">On the programming side, this was the first time I worked on lighting in a game. I first began testing with Unity lights and it just didn't seem right and at some points, just too bright. Since Unity didn't really have "2D" light and 3D light just didn't give the right feeling. I ended up using layer masks to represent light.</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">During this project, I learned alot since the whole project was created over an online setting. Espeically communication wise, there were some hurdles.</p>
