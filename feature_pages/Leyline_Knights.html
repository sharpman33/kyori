			<p class = "feature-info-title">Summary</p>
			<p class = "feature-info-detail">Leyline Knights is a top-down 3D action roguelike game. Player controls a magic-wielding knight and climb the Great World Tree in search of powerful magic to help your sick sibling. Player battles through randomly ordered room encounters and acquire elemental upgrades to aid in their climb. </p>
			<p class = "feature-info-detail">The most challenging part of the project is working with a team of 16. Though the team started off as 3, we slowly grew a total of 16. This is my first time working on a team this large. The project began during a semester where I worked majority on AI with another team member. But when the second semester began, we lost 2 systems programmers, so I shifted to work on back end systems to fill in the gap.</p>

			<p class = "feature-info-title">Enemy AI</p>
			<p class = "feature-info-detail">With many enemies in the game, I worked with another programmer to create enemies. Though we both were new to behavior tree during the beginning, I was able to learn quickly and able to help and collaborate with the other programmer to ensure high quality and optimized work. I first began by making sure that all enemies would have a well-structured class inheritance so in the future, it would be much easier to work with.</p>
			<p class = "feature-info-detail">Each basic enemy has two different tiers. Each tier of enemy has different abilities, and some are casted under certain conditions. This was easily completed using Behavior trees and Blackboard. The most challenging portion is creating the boss. Though some Behavior tree tasks were reused, but majority of them were different. For the boss, since all abilities were chosen by chance, I wanted to create a task that would be reusable on each boss without hard setting the abilities. With all basic functions and behavior tree tasks set up, enemies down the line were much easier to make and were made at a faster rate.</p>

			<p class = "feature-info-title">Rewards System</p>
			<p class = "feature-info-detail">We wanted to have a dynamic reward system as the player players further into the game. And with many upgrade options, the system required a lot of checks. First, I had to check all the available rewards that can spawn and I added it into a array. Then, I created a weight system that utilizes maps(dictionaries) so reward rates can be dynamically changed based on player conditions. To spawn rewards, it grabs a certain value within the weights and if the reward that is chosen is within the array of rewards that are available for spawn, it then spawns the rewards. This challenged me a bit because not only did I have to spawn a single reward, but based on difficulty, rooms can spawn multiple rewards and I had to ensure that there are no duplicate rewards.</p>
			<p class = "feature-info-detail">Once the system was done, I created data assets and added the base values and weights so that designers could easily adjust the values without going into the blueprints.</p>

			<section id="levelgenerator" class ="feature-section">
			<p class = "feature-info-title">Level Generator / Wave System</p>
			<p class = "feature-info-detail"> With the game not allowing backtracking and requiring each level to differ from previous level, level generator was quite simple. I used prebuilt maps created by designers and placed them in arrays. When each level is loaded in, they set each door to a different level. Once the door is used, it removes the level from the array so that the level will never be used again. There are couple restrictions in amount of levels before a certain occurrence. This is completed by having a integer increment as player move through levels and once that threshold is met, it sets all the doors to that occurrence. Levels also have a difficulty rating that changes the enemy tier and element chances during that room. The difficulty is set based on random chance and is set on the doors.</p>
			<p class = "feature-info-detail"> With difficulty in place, the wave system set weights based on the difficulty. This is like the rewards system where it uses weights and adjusts those values based on certain conditions. For element chances, there are base chances and they are adjusted based on the difficulty level. All this information is stored in a data asset so they are easily tweaked. To spawn enemies, it takes the base element weights and added them to the difficulty weights. Then spawns the enemy based on the selected element.</p>

The struct contains all the information of each achievement such as name, description, type, requirement, tier, etc. When actions are done, they check for the type of action and check if it is an achievement, if so, it increases the achievement values.</p>
