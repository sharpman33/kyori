				<p class = "feature-info-detail">War on I4 is my very first game project and surround by a team of talented designer, I learned quickly and progressed a lot as a designer and programmer. During this project, I learned the basics of Unity and learned how to make animations in Unity. My main focus during this project was to design the power ups and pick ups as well as program them. Though I didn't contribute the most during this project, but this was the stepping stone to my game design career.</p>
