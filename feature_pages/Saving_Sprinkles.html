				<p class = "feature-info-detail">Sprinkles is your beloved pet that has gotten dangerously ill. The only way to save your pet is by getting a potion from the pajamas wizard. The wizard tells you that you must sacrifice precious memories in order to create the potion. Go look around and find your precious memories and save sprinkles!</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">Saving Sprinkles is a point and click adventure games. The game originally began with being an object finding game. We decided to add adventure elements to give the player a more interactive feeling when playing the game. Some object are hidden and players must use items to interact with the world.</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail">During this project, it was the first time I worked with raycasting as well as creating a simple inventory system. I progressed a lot as a programmer as a well as designer. The biggest hurdle during this project is making sure that everything gets finished. In a two day period, we may have planned for too much for the amount of man power we had. But overall, the project was a success and we were able to push out the game before the deadline.</p>
