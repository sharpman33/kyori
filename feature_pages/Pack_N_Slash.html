				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> Your wizard tower is being under attack! Place defenses and defend your wizard tower while packing your belongings. You must leave, the region is slowly being overun by evil creatues. Pack everything before its too late.</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> The game is designed around forcing the player to make a descision. They can either stay outside and clear the waves of enemies themselves, or go into the wizard castle to retrieve items to help defend. While that is all happening, the player still needs to pack their belongings to fill the cartridge so they can leave the region.</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> Once the game jam ended, the project is continued slightly differently and removed the aspect of pack but instead added in enemy camps that the player would clear to enhance gear and retrieve items to build defenses.</p>
				<p class = "feature-info-detail"> The game is currently put on hold.</p>
